  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 7124 insulation-crew job-site scheduling/logistics
  coordination actor (itonami actor pattern, ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md
  Actors section; README's 'Robotics premise' — a job-site
  scheduling/logistics coordination robot performs crew scheduling,
  task/materials-usage/progress-record logging and insulation-materials
  supply-order coordination for an insulation crew under this
  advisor/governor pair, which never dispatches hardware itself, never
  performs insulation-installation work itself, and never finalizes an
  insulation-installation-execution decision or overrides a site safety
  officer's judgment — those remain the site safety officer's exclusive
  judgment). Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-7111's housebuilder.store.

  Domain:

    worker  — a registered insulation-crew member (:worker-id, :name)
    site    — a registered insulation job site {:site-id :name
              :max-supply-cost number}. `:max-supply-cost` is an
              informational registered ceiling used only to decide
              whether a `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal escalates
              to human sign-off (the governor never blocks a
              within-threshold order outright; it only decides
              commit vs. escalate).
    record  — a committed operating record (a logged
              task/materials-usage/progress entry, a scheduled crew
              operation, a flagged safety concern, or a coordinated
              supply order) — written ONLY via commit-record!.
    ledger  — append-only audit trail, commit or hold.")
